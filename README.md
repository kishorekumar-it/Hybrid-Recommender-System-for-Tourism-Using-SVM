# Hybrid-Recommender-System-for-Tourism-Using-SVM

Final year project:

The development of the internet, technology and means of communication, the production of tourist data has multiplied at all levels (hotels, restaurants, transport, heritage, tourist events, activities etc). To assist tourists in trip planning and help them to find the information they are looking for, many recommender systems have been developed. Determine the relevant information for tourism data recommendation that is used in the social forum by using the hybrid recommender system. 

Recommender system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the rating or preference of a user would give to an item. The proposed recommendation system uses Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification. It helps tourist with trip planning using conceptual framework.

The objective of developing a recommender system is to promote tourism.
